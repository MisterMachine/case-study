      <p class="lead">Ngaged was contracted by New York University to develop its strategy around courseware, distance learning, and mobile engagement. A pilot program was created to extend the Universityâ€™s efforts to adopt the open source Sakai platform. The Sakai Environment provides a flexible system for teaching, learning, research and collaboration.</p>
      <p>While Sakai is a powerful tool for course administration, it lacks rich classroom interactions for students engagement.
