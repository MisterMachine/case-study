      <p class="lead">The fully featured desktop experience entailed a very complex UI which did not translate well to small screens. As part of our mobile first approach, we began the process of grouping user interactions into silos of engagement. We drafted a number of user stories to determine what the starter interactions were which would set off a chain of more complex scenarios. </p>

If the classroom experience was based on a timeline, then a user "flagging" or interrupting that flow had the most potential for generating fidelity around the relevance of a particular moment in time. Bookmarking could then branch into more complex features such as notes, group discussions, and questions. </p>
